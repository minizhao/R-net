     
**Work In Progress.**


An unofficial implementation of R-net in PyTorch.

[Natural Language Computing Group, MSRA: R-NET: Machine Reading Comprehension with Self-matching Networks](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/mrc/)



Python 3.5/3.6  and PyTorch 0.2


**Usage**

```
python main.py --batch_size 64

```

**Current Problems**

Char-Level embedding with RNN is too slow and requires much GPU memory, so I removed it from my implementation.
I plan to try using CNN to do char-level embedding.

**Performance**

I would like to recommend https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/R-Net (Tensorflow) if you are looking for high performance. Currently my implementation has not fully reached the paper's performance.
